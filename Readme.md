# Car (Data Analyst) PROJECT
## About Project
#### The main objectives of this case study are as follows:
Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:

### Implement data preprocessing techniques to clean and prepare the car dataset for analysis. This involves handling missing values, removing duplicates, and standardizing data formats to ensure data quality.
Sales Analysis:

### Analyze car sales data to uncover insights and propose solutions. This analysis aims to identify patterns, trends, and factors influencing car sales, such as model popularity, pricing strategies, and market demand.
Customer Demographics and Location Analysis:

### Focus on analyzing customer demographics and geographical location to understand preferences and purchasing behaviors. Specifically, we aim to identify which car models are most popular among different demographic groups (age, gender, income) and geographic regions.
Predictive Modeling:

### Utilize predictive modeling techniques to forecast car sales trends and future demand. This involves building predictive models based on historical sales data and external factors (e.g., economic indicators, market trends) to provide insights for strategic planning and decision-making.
